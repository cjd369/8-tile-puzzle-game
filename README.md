# Animated Search Strategies for the 8-Puzzle Tile Game
## Overview: 
Create a web application that uses the 8-puzzle variant of the sliding-tile puzzle (Russell, Norvig 68) to demonstrate and compare a variety of search algorithms.
## Method:
* The team will use React to create an 8-puzzle game. The game will offer three modes of "play":
* Play mode: Offers a randomized or user-selected starting position, and allows the user to attempt to solve the puzzle themselves. Will inform the user if the parity of the puzzle renders it impossible to solve, and will include a move counter and an indication that the user has successfully completed the puzzle.
* Learning mode: A selection of search algorithms will be made available as detailed below. Each algorithm will have an illustrated explanation, and the user will be able to watch the computer solve the puzzle using the chosen algorithm. Additionally, in Play mode, the user will be able to receive hints from the algorithm of choice.
* Test mode: The algorithms will be "pitted against" one another and the user will receive an output showing their results, similar to the table in the textbook (Russell, Norvig 99). The report will include a comparison of the performance of each algorithm
## Algorithms: 
A selection of search algorithms from the textbook, and from Heuristic Search - Theory and Applications by Stefan Edelkamp and Stefan Schroedl will be employed. While the algorithms used in the project may change in the future, the current list of proposed algorithms include breadth-first search, A* using different heuristics, pattern database solutions, and iterative-deepening A* search.
